â€œHave you gone insane? How come to earth you were doing the a Casino?!" My sweet dream was interrupt by the call (in fact yelling) of my mother. Of course I did not spent 10,000 yuan in a casino--it was credit card fraud. Studies shows (data) have once or more expereinced credit card fraud. Especially in card use overseas, credit card information is easily attainable as time differentiates in the banking systems. Although most banks usually discharge the cardholder, the money are not refunded in many cases. How can we use our acknowledge from PSTAT231 to solve this real world problem?

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 The purpose of this project 

### 1.2 Some facts you need to know about Credit Card Fraud
Almost 40 percent of card holders do not have email or text alerts from their credit card company or bank enabled. Around 81 percent of victims without these notifications had to take additional action to reverse fraudulent charges, compared to just 19 percent of those with alerts enabled.

### 1.3 Why might this model be useful?

## 2. An overview of dataset
This project uses MACHINE LEARNING GROUP - ULB's dataset from [Kaggle](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud>)  

The dataset contains credit card transactions done by European cardholders in September 2013.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is quite unbalanced, with frauds making up 0.172% of all transactions in the positive class (frauds) account.  

- `Time`: (Data Type: continuous) Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset  

- `V1-V28`: (Data Type: continuous) May be result of a PCA Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features  

- `Amount`: (Data Type: continuous) Transaction Amount  

- `Class`: (Data Type: nominal) The response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise  
*Note: a full copy of the codebook is available in zipped final projecct files.*
